## Ironhack WebDev Project #3: CatBnb

CatBnb is an online marketplace application focused on connecting cat owners with loving cat-sitters. CatBnb allows users to search for a professional cat-sitter to come over to their homes or, instead, to leave their feline friends under the care of our cat lovers.

CatBnb was developed as a the third and final project for Ironhack's WedDev Full Stack Course. This Single Page Application (SPA) was developed using MERN Stack. Additional dependencies are Bcryptjs, Cors, Express, JsonWebToken, Mongoose and Yup.

We claim no relationship of any nature with Airbnb and this is merely a didatic exercise in coding.

## Acknowledgments

After 4 weeks of intense studying, coding and trial-and-error the group managed to develop a fully functional SPA. It would not have been possible without the invaluable help from our teacher Henrique Mendes and our teacher assistants Flávia Maia and Henrique Morikawa. We also extend our thanks to coding YouTube and StackExchange communities.

## Technologies

* Stack used in production: NodeJS, ExpressJS, Mongoose, Cors and Bcrypt.
* Requests implemented: GET, POST, PUT & DELETE
* Deployed at: Heroku

## Prerequisites

This SPA has no prerequisites and is ready to be used from the link provided above.

## Environmental parametres

This SPA has the following environmental variables, which need to be inserted in your own `.env` file:

```
PORT=YOUR_LOCALHOST_ACCESS_PORT
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/YOUR_COLLECTION_NAME_IN_MONGODB
TOKEN_LOGIN_SK=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
LOGIN_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=YOUR_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_TIME
CATBNB_URI=YOUR_LOCALHOST_URI
```

## Additional implementations and improvements

This SPA is fully functional in its current state, but we believe that the next steps would be valuable to improve user's experience:

* Further develop the date picker to allow for range picking;
* Add a live chat component to the SPA;
* Add automated e-mails delivery with reservation confirmation and details                          .
